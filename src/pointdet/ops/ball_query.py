    Ball Query is an alternative to KNN. It can be
    used to find all points in p2 that are within a specified radius
    to the query point in p1 (with an upper limit of K neighbors).

    The neighbors returned are not necssarily the *nearest* to the
    point in p1, just the first K values in p2 which are within the
    specified radius.

    This method is faster than kNN when there are large numbers of points
    in p2 and the ordering of neighbors is not important compared to the
    distance being within the radius threshold.

    "Ball queryâ€™s local neighborhood guarantees a fixed region scale thus
    making local region features more generalizable across space, which is
    preferred for tasks requiring local pattern recognition
    (e.g. semantic point labeling)" [1].

        on Point Sets in a Metric Space", NeurIPS 2017.

    Args:
        centroids: Tensor of shape (B, K, D) giving a batch of B point clouds, each containing
            up to P1 points of dimension D. These represent the centers of the ball queries.
        points: Tensor of shape (B, N, D) giving a batch of B point clouds, each containing
            up to P2 points of dimension D.
        num_neighbors: upper bound on the number of samples to take within the radius
        radius: the radius around each point within which the neighbors need to be located
        lengths1: LongTensor of shape (B,) of values in the range [0, P1], giving the length
            of each pointcloud in p1. Or None to indicate that every cloud has length P1.
        lengths2: LongTensor of shape (B,) of values in the range [0, P2], giving the length
            of each pointcloud in p2. Or None to indicate that every cloud has length P2.

    Returns:
        indices: (B, K, num_neighbors) the indices of S neighbors in p2 for points in p1.
            Concretely, if `p1_idx[n, i, k] = j` then `p2[n, j]` is the k-th
            neighbor to `p1[n, i]` in `p2[n]`. This is padded with -1 both where a cloud
            in p2 has fewer than S points and where a cloud in p1 has fewer than P1 points
            and also if there are fewer than K points which satisfy the radius threshold.
